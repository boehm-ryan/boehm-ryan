## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying at Champlain College! I consider myself a gameplay/systems programmer with a keen interest in making fun, engaging, and interesting mechanics in games. I've worked on many interesting projects, including a zombie survival game with me as the sole programmer on that team, and I've also worked on a bunch of projects while studying at Champlain. Currently, I am working on a squirrel platformer where you throw acorns and make platforms to traverse through the levels. Hope you enjoy what I've done!
